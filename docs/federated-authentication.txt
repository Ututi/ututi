Federated authentication
========================


Login policy
============

We currently support authentication using Facebook and Google.

Google provides a unique identifier for a user, Facebook provides an UID. They
are used to associate user accounts with Google/Facebook accounts.

There are three login scenarios: id match, e-mail match, no match.

ID Match
--------

Condition: An Ututi account is found  who is already associated with the given
ID.

Scenario 1: a user is logging into his own Ututi account [assume]
Scenario 2: a user is logging in while a Facebook session for another user is
active [disregard]

Action: log user in, no questions asked.

Email match
-----------

Condition: no Ututi accounts are associated with the given Facebook/Google id,
but there is an Ututi account whose email matches.

Scenario 1: the Ututi account belongs to the user
Scenario 2: the Ututi account belongs to a different user (e.g., shared emails)
[disregard]

Action: associate Facebook/Google account with Ututi account, log user in

No match
--------

Scenario 1: new Ututi user
Scenario 2: existing Ututi user who registered with a different email address

Action: show double form:
1) reduced registration form, prefilled with name, email from Google/FB.
2) standard login form (email & password) for association of Google/FB with
an existing account.


Account settings
================

The account settings view should show the status of association with
Google/FB accounts and buttons to sever the links.
