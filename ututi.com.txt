* Add global admin users, admin log in layer

** Move some views from ututi admin into university admin views.

* Fix up security crowds:

  - Remove marketeers crowd
  - Only allow confirmed emails to be counted as logged in users

Suggestion is - replace the authenticated User object with a different
object that is not directly tied to the database. That object will
have a reference to the logged in user most of the time, but in case
of admin users - he will not. Crowd checkers will be able to perform
the crowd checks even without user object available.

* Merge forum and mailinglist code and create dicussions content objects, wall snippets, etc.

* Export/Import data

        # metadata
        # export all subjects
        #   export pages on the subjects
        #   export files on the subjects
        # export all groups
        #   do not export group pages
        #   export group files
        # collect all users from those groups
        #   export users
        # collect all users from this university
        #
        # collect all the events
        # only one type of groups - discussions!

        # tags - out
        # discussion moderation queue for groups?
        # discussions will have better email support than current forums!

        # files - everything stays
        # fortumo lieka, palaikys visas europos šalis
        # paypalas - atsiras
        # forumai lieka bet tik universitetams, galima followinti

        # @ututi.com emailai

        # search - lieka, bet keisis, atsiras privatumo nustatymai


        # paremk ututi, rėmėjų sąrašas

        # default useris studentas, gali upgradintis į teacherį, kas
        # skirsis kai būsi universiteto adminas?
        # teacherius reikia patvirtinti, juos tvirtina universiteto adminas


        # group_welcome_page - lauk
        # community and bugs forums - lauk
        # group_coupons - lauk
        # Blog - lauk
        # Books - lauk, nebent nesunkiai prisukam prie universiteto



* Helpful stats

Users watching subjecs but without universities selected.

select user_monitored_subjects.user_id, count(*) from user_monitored_subjects
     left outer join group_members on user_monitored_subjects.user_id = group_members.user_id
     left join users on users.id = user_monitored_subjects.user_id
     where ignored = False and group_members.group_id is null and users.location_id is null
     group by user_monitored_subjects.user_id;
