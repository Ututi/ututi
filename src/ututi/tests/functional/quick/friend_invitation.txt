   >>> mail_queue[:] = []

And after all this we are redirected back to where we came from.

   >>> browser.url
   'http://localhost/home/start'

Plus, a status message is displayed:

   >>> browser.printQuery("//div[@class='flash-message']/span/text()")
   Invitations sent to somenewuser@example.com

User can add personal message to the invitation that is sent:

   >>> browser.open('http://localhost/home/start')
   >>> form = browser.getForm(id='invite-email-form')
   >>> form.getControl('Recipients:').value = 'someotheruser@example.com'
   >>> form.getControl('Add personal message (optional):').value = 'Hey, come and try Ututi. I found it rather nice.'
   >>> form.getControl('Send invitation').click()
