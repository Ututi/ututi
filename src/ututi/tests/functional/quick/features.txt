Test features view
==================

We just want to be sure, that /features view is still here and is
accesible from frontpage.

    >>> user = Browser()
    >>> user.open('http://localhost/')
    >>> user.click('What is Ututi?')
    >>> user.printCssQuery('.page-title', strip=True)
    <h1>What is Ututi?</h1>
