Test converting users into teachers
===================================

    >>> browser = Browser.logIn()
    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/admin')
    >>> browser.getLink('Teachers').click()

Find a user by his id:

    >>> form = browser.getForm(id='user_search')
    >>> form.getControl('User ID').value = '2'
    >>> form.getControl('Find').click()
    >>> browser.printQuery("id('teacher_list')//td[@class='name']//text()")
    Alternative user

And make him a teacher:

    >>> browser.getControl('Make a teacher').click()

He should receive and email:

    >>> from ututi.lib.mailer import mail_queue
    >>> print mail_queue.pop().payload()
    Alternative user,

Oh, we can also lookup users by their names:
    >>> form = browser.getForm(id='user_search')
    >>> form.getControl('User name').value = 'user'
    >>> form.getControl('Find').click()
    >>> browser.printQuery("id('teacher_list')//td[@class='name']//text()")
    Second user
    Third user
    Alternative user

The teacher is immediately verified:
    >>> browser.printQuery("id('teacher_unverified')//text()")
