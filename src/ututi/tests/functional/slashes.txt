Trailing slashes
================

We should get redirect to a view without trailing slashes:

    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/search/')
    >>> print browser.url
    http://localhost/search

This should preserve the get parameters, but for some reason it does not. Will do for now.

    >>> browser.open("http://localhost/search/?text='abra'")
    >>> print browser.url
    http://localhost/search
