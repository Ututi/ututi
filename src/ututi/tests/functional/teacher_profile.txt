Test teacher's workflow
======================================

Let's login as a verified teacher and go to profile:

    >>> teacher = Browser.logIn('benas@ututi.lt', 'password')
    >>> teacher.click('(edit profile)')

Let's enter teacher's full name and position

    >>> teacher.getControl('Full name').value = 'Benas Benaitis'
    >>> teacher.getControl('Position').value = 'Smart teacher'
    >>> teacher.click('Save')

Let's check that profile general information was saved successfully

    >>> teacher.printCssQuery('.flash-message-content', strip=True)
    <span>Your profile was updated.</span>

    >>> teacher.getControl('Full name').value
    'Benas Benaitis'
    >>> teacher.getControl('Position').value
    'Smart teacher'
    >>> teacher.printCssQuery('.base-url', strip=True)
    <span>http://localhost/teacher/</span>
