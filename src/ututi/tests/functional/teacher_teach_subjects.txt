Test teacher's "teaching subjects" functionality
================================================

Let's login as a verified teacher:

    >>> browser = Browser()
    >>> form = browser.getForm('loginForm')
    >>> form.getControl('Email').value = "benas@ututi.lt"
    >>> form.getControl('Password').value = "password"
    >>> form.getControl('Login').click()

There's yet no nice way to add subjects! As for now, Benas
visits subject page directly:

    >>> browser.open('http://localhost/subject/vu/mat_analize')

Teacher can click "I teach this course" button. He is then stays on
the course page and a flash message is displayed:

    >>> browser.getControl("I teach this course").click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://localhost/subject/vu/mat_analize'

    >>> browser.printQuery("//div[@class='flash-message']/span/text()")
    The course has been added to your taught courses list.

If he wants to, he can say that he is no longer teaching this course.
Again, an appropriate flash message is displayed:

    >>> browser.getControl("Remove from my taught courses").click()
    >>> browser.url
    'http://localhost/subject/vu/mat_analize'

    >>> browser.printQuery("//div[@class='flash-message']/span/text()")
    The course has been removed from your taught courses list.
